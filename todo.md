# Todo

## Priority:High
- Fiddle with NERDCommenter to add one space before comment
- Make neomake not expand or move fzf to top
- Block certain notifications on Linux mint (battery) while others are unblocked (Slack)
- Check out node inspector and the chrome debugger
- Set fzf.vim :Ag to an exact match or start Ag with a specific query

## Priority:Low
- Remove the focus-event plugin and clear the tmux file? since neovim has already implemented this
  by default. See https://github.com/tmux-plugins/vim-tmux-focus-events/pull/4
..*Test before you commit
- Add tags to various repos cf
- Learn vim folds
- Write vim-github viewer
- Try iabbrev in vim
- Try https://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown
- Look into bash script testing so that your install scripts don't break constantly
- Write a fzf helper for `git status` files
- Write a script for resizing of tmux and vim windows transparently, just like switching is done.
- Write a vim fzf helper to show edited git files
- Add a global gitignore
- Add vimscript snippets
- Map C-g to echo new prompt when done selecting
- Look into fixmyjs (or alternatives) for more than semicolon fixing
- Add jscs formatting if it exists to vim-autoformat
