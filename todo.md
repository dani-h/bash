# Todo

## Priority:High
- Block certain notifications on Linux mint (battery) while others are unblocked (Slack)
- Check out node inspector and the chrome debugger
- Write a script for resizing of tmux and vim windows transparently, just like switching is done.
- Figure out how pgp signing works
- Improve your workflow using tpope/vim-fugitive. Specifically get used to
  :Gdiff, :Gstatus, :Glog, :Gblame, :Gbrowse (github), :Gread and integrate it with statusline

## Priority:Low
- Get used to gf, gd, gq in vim
- Look at fpm
- Remove the focus-event plugin and clear the tmux file? since neovim has already implemented this
  by default. See https://github.com/tmux-plugins/vim-tmux-focus-events/pull/4
..*Test before you commit
- Learn vim folds
- Write vim-github viewer
- Try iabbrev in vim
- Try https://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown
- Look into bash script testing so that your install scripts don't break constantly
- Write a vim fzf helper to show edited git files
- Add vimscript snippets
- Map fzf-git-status (C-g) to echo new prompt when done selecting
- Look into fixmyjs (or alternatives) for more than semicolon fixing
- Add jscs formatting if it exists to vim-autoformat
- Figure out how to store encrypted files in public repos
